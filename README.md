# **Deep Learning  - Salary Income Bracket Prediction using TensorFlow**

### **Overview**

This project aims to predict salary income brackets (whether income is less than or greater than $50k) using a TensorFlow model. The dataset used for training and testing contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, etc., and the target variable is the income bracket.
Dataset

### **Dataset Characteristics**

    Type: Multivariate
    Subject Area: Social Sciences
    Associated Tasks: Classification
    Feature Type: Integer, Real
    Number of Instances: 32560
    Number of Features: 14

### **Framework**

- Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset by encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

- Model Architecture: Define the architecture of your TensorFlow model. Since this is a binary classification problem, a simple neural network with a binary output layer can be used.

- Training: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Then, train your TensorFlow model using the training data.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing dataset.

- Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

- Deployment in Hugging Faces
